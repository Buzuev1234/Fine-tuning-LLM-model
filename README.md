# Finetune-Open-Source-LLMs-on-Custom-Data

## Project Overview

The project aims to showcase the process of fine-tuning LLMs on industry-specific data. The provided notebook (`FinetuneOpenSourceLLMs.ipynb`) walks through the steps, utilizing Amazon's sales data (`ConvAI_Data.csv`).

## Files

- **Input Data**: `ConvAI_Data.csv`
  - This CSV file contains the E-commerce data used for fine-tuning.

- **Python Notebook**: `FinetuneOpenSourceLLMs.ipynb`
  - Jupyter notebook providing a step-by-step guide on how to fine-tune open-source LLMs on custom data.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Finetune-Open-Source-LLMs-on-Custom-Data.git
   cd Finetune-Open-Source-LLMs-on-Custom-Data
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FinetuneOpenSourceLLMs.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and apply fine-tuning on open-source LLMs.
